    0	UNSENT	Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	OPENED	open() has been called.
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4	DONE	The operation is complete.

In synchronous programming, operations are performed one after the other, in sequence. So, basically each line of code waits for the
 previous one to finish before proceeding to the next. 

 Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple tasks to run independently of each other. In asynchronous code, a task can
  be initiated, and while waiting for it to complete, other tasks can proceed.

<!-- In technical terms:
0 (Unsent): You created the request but didn’t call open() yet.

1 (Opened): You called open(), but haven’t sent it yet.

2 (Headers received): Server responded with status (like 200 OK), but not the body.

3 (Loading): Receiving data from the server bit by bit.

4 (Done): Response is completely received and ready to use. -->

<!-- let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();----0

xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  console.log("Ready state:", xhr.readyState);
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    console.log("Response received:", xhr.responseText);
  }
};
//ready to get the request
xhr.open("GET", "data.json");  // readyState becomes 1------1
xhr.send();                    // begins the request -----2


Create the request → new XMLHttpRequest() → readyState = 0

Open the request (set method and URL) → .open() → readyState = 1

Send the request → .send() → readyState = 2 (headers received)

Receiving the data → readyState = 3

All data received → readyState = 4-->
