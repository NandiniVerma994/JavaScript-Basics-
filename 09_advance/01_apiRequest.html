In synchronous programming, operations are performed one after the other, in sequence. So, basically each line of code waits for the
 previous one to finish before proceeding to the next. 

 Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple tasks to run independently of each other. In asynchronous code, a task can
  be initiated, and while waiting for it to complete, other tasks can proceed.
